# Zenblock
## Glean 12 hours of output from 8 hours of work through intentional scheduling. We make it easy. 

Zenblock is a time blocking app. Cal Newport, CS researcher and author, estimates that people gain 1.5x output from a time blocked day compared to an unscheduled day. Time blocking is used by top performers like Elon Musk and Marc Andressen, but it has a learning curve. Zenblock lowers this learning curve through time tracking features and automatic rescheduling when interruptions occur.
